# ETHNOCOPIA Code Review

The coding approach violates some of the standard practices such as coding SOLID principles etc, as there seem to be 
little segregation. Below are my recommendations

## Entity Class Recommendations
1. Moving the `Customer` class to an entity package is a good practice for organizing the code.
2. Using Lombok annotations for getters, setters, constructors, and other boilerplate code can indeed make the code cleaner and more concise.
3. Switching the `id` data type to `Long` is a sensible choice, as it provides more room for unique identifiers.
4. Making instance variables `non-nullable` when appropriate is a good practice to maintain data consistency.
5. Marking the `email` field as unique is a valid way to prevent duplicate accounts.
6. Adding timestamps for audit purposes is a good practice for tracking changes.

## DTO Recommendations
1. Creating DTOs to separate the data transfer from the entity objects is a good design practice, especially for APIs.
2. Adding validation annotations, such as `@NonNull`, to DTOs can help ensure data integrity before passing it to the entity.

## Repository Recommendations
1. Organizing repositories in their own folder is a good practice for code organization.
2. Switching the data type for the `id` field to `Long` in both the repository and entity is consistent and recommended.

## Service Recommendation
1. Segregating code into a service class is a good way to separate business logic from controller code. 
2. Creating a service interface and providing an implementation is a standard design pattern. 
3. Returning a `ResponseEntity` with meaningful information is a good practice for API responses.
4. Handling HTTP status codes appropriately based on success or failure is important for API design. 
5. Implementing email checking to prevent duplicate entries is a valid approach.

## Controller Recommendations
1. Segregating code into a controller class is a good practice for separating API endpoints from other logic.

## General Recommendations
1. Implementing an exception handler using `@RestControllerAdvice` is a best practice for dealing with exceptions in a 
standardized manner.
2. Catching and handling exceptions appropriately is crucial for robust and reliable code.
3. Your efforts to improve the code's quality and maintainability are commendable.
